          <p>Team Fortress 2 is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve Software as part of the game bundle The Orange Box. It was first released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on October 10, 2007. A PlayStation 3 version then followed on November 22, 2007. Following suit, it was released as a standalone title on April 9, 2008, and on June 10, 2010, Team Fortress 2 was released for Mac OS X. The PC and OS X versions of Team Fortress 2 adopted a "Free to Play" model on June 23, 2011, with all revenue being generated from microtransactions in the In-game Store. After several months of closed beta, Team Fortress 2 was finally released for Linux operating systems on February 14, 2013.</p>
          
          <p>The game was first announced in 1998 as a sequel to the original Team Fortress mod for Quake (a first-person shooter video game, developed by id Software), but has since been through various concept and design periods. In 1999, the game appeared to be abandoning the art styles of the original Team Fortress Classic by transitioning toward a more realistic and militaristic style of gameplay. However, the design continued evolving over the game's nine-year development period and game engine switch. The final art style rendition of Team Fortress 2 resembles that of the original Team Fortress and Team Fortress Classic games, and also features a cartoon-like visual style based on the art of Dean Cornwell, J. C Leyendecker, and Norman Rockwell. Team Fortress 2 follows a popular trend in recent CGI films, in particular, films recently made by Pixar, such as The Incredibles.</p>
